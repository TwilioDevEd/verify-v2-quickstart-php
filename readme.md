## Set up

### Requirements

- [PHP >= 7.2.5](https://www.php.net/) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your own application.
Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config&nbsp;Value | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account&nbsp;Sid  | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Auth&nbsp;Token   | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll find this here](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Verification&nbsp;Sid |  For Verification Service. You can generate one [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services) |

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/verify-v2-quickstart-php.git
    cd verify-v2-quickstart-php
    ```

1. Set your environment variables

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

1. Install PHP dependencies

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    make serve
    ```

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

    That's it!

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed on your machine, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` to setup your project.

1. Make sure you have the project cloned.
2. Setup the `.env` file as outlined in the [Local Development](#local-development) steps.
3. Run `docker-compose up`.

### Unit and Integration Tests

You can run the Unit and Feature tests locally by typing:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.

| Service                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
